There are desktop-related scripts in ~/TIDUS
desktopthread - posts desktop in /g/ and opens firefox to it

If you're new to GNU/Linux, type startx now to start xmonad
Once there, windows key + r = type name of program to run
windows key + number = go to desktop of number you pressed
windows key + f = open firefox (opens on desktop 2)
